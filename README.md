### Hi, I'm Ugur Randa

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science (F-1 visa), currently based in California, USA.

I transitioned from Mechanical Engineering (5+ years experience) into the world of tech ‚Äî now focusing on **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **NLP**.

I love building practical projects and exploring real-world applications of Python, SQL, and AI technologies.

I'm actively looking for internships or entry-level roles where I can grow, contribute, and learn alongside passionate teams.
